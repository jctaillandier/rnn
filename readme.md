# Various RNN Implementation


- Line 279 in ptb-lm.py if need to change path to data
- ptb-lm.py runs the program, and gives access to type of model (rnn, GRU, Transformer) with flags you can see in file comments.
- --model flag can be =RNN for vanilla RNN, GRU for a gated recurrent unit and TRANSFORMER for a transformer network(architecture following the 'attention is all you need paper')
